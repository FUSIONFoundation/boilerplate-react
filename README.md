This boilerplate was created to encourage and help developers bootstrap a FUSION application as fast as possible. With several code snippets available this boilerplate gives a good example on how to utilize FUSION's functions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Getting Started

Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FUSIONFoundation/boilerplate-react.git
```
```bash
$ cd boilerplate-react
```
Install all dependencies
```bash
$ npm i
```
Start the application

```bash
$ npm start
```
Your browser will open ``localhost:3000``

Edit the Fusion component found in ``Components/``

## Features

In this boilerplate we have added several functions to ensure any developer can get started by looking at the code examples. 
Therefore we decided to integrate three functions: Send Asset, Create Asset and Get Address By Notation.
The function to create an account object from a Private Key is also included.
Several other utility functions were added on how to format a balance, format a given amount in wei and whether a user owns a certain asset.

Please, refer to the [FUSION API Documentation](https://fusionapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to view all available functions.
Also, if you are having any troubles or you have any questions on how to utilize the protocol, feel free to join our Developers Community on Telegram.
